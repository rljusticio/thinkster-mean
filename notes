-The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through the creation of a Reddit/Hacker News clone using the MEAN stack
  -gain a basic understanding of the MEAN stack
  -build a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js
    -use that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.

-major benefit of the MEAN stack is that it's extremely quick to prototype with.
-Node.js allows us to use Javascript on the backend as well as the frontend
  -saves us from having to learn a separate language.

-the NoSQL nature of MongoDB allows us to quickly change and alter the data layer without having to worry about migrations, which is a very valuable attribute when you're trying to build a product without clear specifications.

-these technologies have a lot of community support behind them
  -so finding answers to questions or hiring help is going to be much easier using these technologies.
