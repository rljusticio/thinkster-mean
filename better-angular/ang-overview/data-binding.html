    <!--
      In Angular, a file like this is called a template

      When Angular starts your application, it parses and processes this new markup from the template using the compiler

      The loaded, transformed and rendered DOM is then called the view

      The first kind of new markup are the directives.

      They apply special behavior to attributes or elements in the HTML.

      We use the ng-app attribute, which is linked to a directive that automatically initializes our application
    -->
    <div ng-app ng-init="qty=1;cost=2">
      <b>Invoice:</b>
      <div>
        <!-- The ng-model directive stores/updates the value of the input field into/from a variable -->
        Quantity: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="qty">
      </div>
      <div>
        Costs: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="cost">
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Total:</b> {{qty * cost | currency}}
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
