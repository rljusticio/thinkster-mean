Kicking the Tires
-angular is not a library
-it is a JavaScript framework that embraces extending HTML into a more expressive and readable format

-allows us to decorate our HTML with special markup that synchronizes with our JavaScript leaving us to write our application logic instead of manually updating views
  -see ./ang-overview

A First Example: Data-Binding
-build a form to calculate the cost of an invoice in different currencies
-see ./ang-overview/data-binding.html
