      The final way to bind data is one-time binding. As the name suggests, this means the data is only read once from the source, then the data between the source and the view are no longer synchronized

      This will come in handy as your application grows as it is a much less resource intensive way of displaying static data or data that only needs to be read once

      <!-- here we use a one-time binding which made it so once the value in message was compared to hello, that specific expression stopped listening for changes to message, leaving the value of true to stay in that paragraph regardless of what we put into our text input -->
