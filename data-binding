Data-binding
-Data-binding in Angular apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components
-The way that Angular implements data-binding lets you treat the model as the single-source-of-truth in your application.
-The view is a projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.

Data Binding in Classical Template Systems
-Most templating systems bind data in only one direction: they merge template and model components together into a view.
-After the merge occurs, changes to the model or related sections of the view are NOT automatically reflected in the view
-any changes that the user makes to the view are not reflected in the model.
  -This means that the developer has to write code that constantly syncs the view with the model and the model with the view.

Data Binding in Angular Templates
-the template (which is the uncompiled HTML along with any additional markup or directives) is compiled on the browser.
-The compilation step produces a live view.
-Any changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model, and any changes in the model are propagated to the view.
-The model is the single-source-of-truth for the application state, greatly simplifying the programming model for the developer.
-think of the view as simply an instant projection of your model.
